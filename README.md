# Internship Tasks I Completed

## Task 1: Simple Calculator
In this task, I created a very simple calculator with takes two numbers as input from user and then displays the operation menu telling him/her what operations(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division) they can perform. The program asks them to choose any one operation to perform on the numbers they provided earlier. At last, the program display the answer it gets.

## Task 2: To-Do List
In this task, I create a simple console-based To-Do List Manager. The program first displays the user Operation Menu which tells them what they can perform. It includes adding a task to the list, viewing all tasks and their status (whether completed or not), marking any Task as Completed and removing any task from the list. The proram asks user to chose any one of the operation from the menu to perform and they performs the operation with user-friendly interaction.

## Task 3:Library Management System
In my final task, I created a user-friendly Library Management System which performs the following operaions:-
1. Stores Book Information provided by user.
2. Search the Book for the user in the database.
3. Checks out a Book for borrower.
4. Records Books return, Updates Availability Status and calculates Fine for overdue Books (Fine of ₹75 per month is imposed for late submission of books for a year. After one year, the borrower have to pay in total ₹1000 for late submission).
The program displays the operation menu and asks the user to choose any operation to perform. Then it performs that operation by asking the necessary details from user and at last displays a completion message.
